What is Emmet ?

Emmet is a free add on the text editors, With the help of emmet we can use some shortcuts which will then be expanded to the full pieces of code,This saves a lot of time of 
developers as they have to write less code manually.
Some examples of Emmet shortcuts : Li*4 , div>ul>li


Difference between library and framework ? 

Basically both are the reusable code written by someone else which help us to solve common problems in easier ways.Big Difference is like in a library it requires minimal
effort to add in your code, also you are in charge of the flow of the application.Whereas in the framework , the framework is in charge of the application.
Learning curve of libraries are less as compared to frameworks.


What is CDN? Why we use it ? 

Stands for Content Delivery Network.Basically it is a network of geographically dispersed severs.Main idea behind CDN is like if a user is trying to access a site so the data should be provided from the nearest server rather than the original server , it will save time and improve user experience.It is an optimization technique and allow to reduce load or traffic on a single server.

Why is React known as React ? 

So basically React was created by Facebook , and in facebook its a kind of app that always has a changing data . So react is a view in MVC and it should change or react
whenever user tries to interact with the app, user events and like that so its known as react.

What is CrossOrigin in script tag ? 

So basically crossorigin request is a request from a cross orogin url means from a different url(not the original url).So it depends on us if we want to share the user credentials with the cross origin or not so when you write cross origin as anonymous so no data shared else use credentials it will share the data.

What is the difference between React and React Dom?

React developers thought of splitting both the React library which deals with creating components , beautiful interface , from React Dom whose main function is just to put all the content to browser DOM . So ReactDom binds the React to Browser , but that is not true like we can even use in mobile devices which React Native so there instead of ReactDom we use something else ,So the split is in a way better.

What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?

In production we have minified version of the files because in production means the most and minified version will take less time and enhance performance whereas in development its not that much needed.

What is async and defer?

These are the tags that can be used in Script , So in async the script is fetched asynchronously and when they are available they are executed by stoping HTML parsing at that time , but in defer the the script is fetched parallely as well but it will execute only once HTML will stop parsing.Use defer in most cases.

What is Npm ?

Npm is a package manager.When you install Node js in your system npm comes along with it .You can download various packages with the help of npm that can be used in your project as dependency.
Eg npm install <package-name>
or npm install <package-name>@version
These packages, some details are entered into package.json like they will come as dependency with their version , and in package lock it will lock the exact dependency
version and their subsequent dependency versions .And the package code is extracted in node modules , that can be used in your code according to your need in your app.

What is parcel/Webpack ? Why do you need it ? 

So basically these are bundlers . Their main job is to bundle, minify various js files and their dependencies into a static asset(js file) so that it can be served on the browser.As we can not ship so many js files in production , as it will make our user experience really bad , so bundlers simply try to minify our js in the smallest amount possible to enhance user experience. 

What is npx ? 

Npx simply means executing a package without downloading it. When we use npm first we need to install a package and then we need to run it .
like 
npm i <package-name>
npm run <package-name>
but with npx we just have to 
npx <package-name>
and it will get executed , So Npx is better when we have to use a package just one or 2 times in your project.After version 5.2 Npx comes bundled with Npm.

What is dependencies and dev dependencies ?

So basically dependency means a package that your project uses ,There are a very few projects that do not need any packages from outside.
So we can easily install dependencies using npm i <package-name>
It will be added under dependency inside package.json file.It will be available in run time aswell.
Whereas Dev Dependency are only available during development environment.
You can install them npm i -D <package-name>
And they will be added under dev-dependencies inside pacakge.json
Eg of dependencies would be react redux, and dev dependencies would be testing tools like enzyme , mocha
